# Resource Manager Agent

## Purpose

Specialized agent for monitoring and controlling resource usage during flutter_keycheck operations. Ensures system stability by enforcing resource limits and implementing progressive execution strategies.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Resource Monitoring
- Monitor CPU usage in real-time
- Track memory consumption patterns
- Measure I/O throughput and disk usage
- Monitor concurrent agent/task counts

### 2. Resource Throttling
- Enforce 50% CPU usage limit
- Limit memory usage to 1GB maximum
- Control concurrent agent execution (max 2)
- Implement progressive backoff on resource pressure

### 3. Performance Optimization
- Queue operations when resource limits reached
- Prioritize critical operations over background tasks
- Implement smart batching for file operations
- Enable incremental/lazy loading strategies

### 4. System Health Protection
- Emergency shutdown on resource exhaustion
- Graceful degradation under pressure
- Resource usage reporting and alerts
- Recovery strategies for resource issues

## Resource Limits Configuration

```yaml
cpu_limits:
  max_usage_percent: 50
  throttle_threshold: 45
  emergency_threshold: 90

memory_limits:
  max_usage_mb: 1024
  warning_threshold: 800
  emergency_threshold: 950

concurrency_limits:
  max_concurrent_agents: 2
  max_concurrent_tasks: 3
  max_parallel_files: 10

operation_timeouts:
  default_timeout: 300000  # 5 minutes
  file_operation: 30000    # 30 seconds
  ast_parsing: 60000       # 1 minute
```

## Progressive Execution Strategy

### Phase 1: Normal Operations (< 40% resources)
- Full parallel processing enabled
- All optimization features active
- Aggressive caching and preloading

### Phase 2: Throttled Operations (40-50% resources)
- Reduce concurrent operations by 50%
- Disable non-essential caching
- Implement operation queuing

### Phase 3: Emergency Mode (> 50% resources)
- Single-threaded execution only
- Essential operations only
- Force garbage collection
- Pause non-critical background tasks

## Usage Patterns

### Automatic Resource Control
```dart
// The agent automatically monitors and throttles operations
final scanner = AstScannerV3(
  enableResourceManagement: true,
  maxCpuPercent: 50,
  maxMemoryMB: 1024,
);
```

### Manual Resource Monitoring
```dart
// Check resource usage before expensive operations
if (resourceManager.canExecuteOperation(operationType)) {
  await performExpensiveOperation();
} else {
  await resourceManager.queueOperation(operation);
}
```

### Progressive Execution
```dart
// Automatically adapt execution strategy based on resources
final strategy = resourceManager.getExecutionStrategy();
switch (strategy) {
  case ExecutionStrategy.normal:
    return await fullParallelExecution();
  case ExecutionStrategy.throttled:
    return await reducedParallelExecution();
  case ExecutionStrategy.emergency:
    return await singleThreadedExecution();
}
```

## Integration Points

### With AST Scanner
- Monitor parsing operations
- Throttle file processing when needed
- Implement lazy loading for large files

### With Performance Optimizer
- Coordinate resource-aware optimizations
- Balance speed vs resource usage
- Implement intelligent caching strategies

### With Report Generator
- Stream large report generation
- Progressive rendering for HTML dashboards
- Memory-efficient chart generation

### With CI/CD Pipeline
- Resource-aware test execution
- Throttled parallel builds
- Emergency circuit breakers

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Resource Metrics
- Real-time CPU and memory usage graphs
- Operation queue lengths and wait times
- Throughput metrics (operations/second)
- Resource efficiency ratios

### Alert Conditions
- CPU usage > 45% for 30+ seconds
- Memory usage > 800MB
- Operation queue length > 10
- Emergency throttling activated

### Recovery Actions
- Automatic operation rescheduling
- Garbage collection triggering
- Cache cleanup and optimization
- Progress save/restore for long operations

## Best Practices

### For Developers
1. Always check resource availability before expensive operations
2. Implement cancellation tokens for long-running operations
3. Use progressive loading strategies for large datasets
4. Monitor resource usage in development and testing

### For CI/CD
1. Configure appropriate resource limits for build environments
2. Implement timeouts and circuit breakers
3. Use resource-aware parallel execution strategies
4. Monitor and alert on resource usage patterns

### For End Users
1. Use `--low-resource` flag for constrained environments
2. Enable incremental scanning for large projects
3. Configure appropriate cache sizes for available memory
4. Monitor system performance during scans

## Emergency Protocols

### Resource Exhaustion
1. Immediately pause all non-critical operations
2. Force garbage collection and cache cleanup
3. Save current progress to disk
4. Notify user of resource constraints
5. Provide recovery options (reduce scope, increase limits, etc.)

### System Stability
1. Never exceed configured resource limits
2. Gracefully degrade performance before system impact
3. Provide clear feedback on resource constraints
4. Enable easy recovery from resource issues

This agent ensures flutter_keycheck operations remain within acceptable resource boundaries while maintaining optimal performance for the given constraints.
