### ‚ö†Ô∏è BREAKING: Deleted Legacy Binaries
- **Removed**: `bin/flutter_keycheck_v2.dart`
- **Removed**: `bin/flutter_keycheck_v3.dart`  
- **Removed**: `bin/flutter_keycheck_v3_complete.dart`
- **Removed**: `bin/flutter_keycheck_v3_integrated.dart`
- **Removed**: `bin/flutter_keycheck_v3_proper.dart`
- **Unified**: Only `bin/flutter_keycheck.dart` remains

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes

#### CLI Migration to Subcommands
- **Old**: `flutter_keycheck --keys file.yaml --strict`
- **New**: `flutter_keycheck validate --strict`
- Primary command is now `validate` (with `ci-validate` alias)
- All functionality moved to explicit subcommands

#### Exit Codes Standardized
- `0`: Success - all validations passed
- `1`: Policy violation - thresholds not met, critical keys missing
- `2`: Configuration error - invalid config, missing files
- `3`: I/O or sync error - file access, git operations
- `4`: Internal error - unexpected failures

#### Schema v1.0
- New standardized JSON schema for scan coverage metrics
- `parse_success_rate` is now a fraction (0.0 to 1.0), not percentage
- Structured metrics with `files_total`, `files_scanned`, `widgets_total`, etc.
- Detector effectiveness tracking with `detectors[]` array

### ‚ú® New Features

#### Core Commands
- **scan**: Build current snapshot with AST parsing and key‚Üîhandler linking
- **baseline**: Create/update/delete baselines for tracking changes
- **diff**: Compare snapshots to detect key drift
- **validate**: Primary validation command (ci-validate alias available)
- **sync**: Sync with external key registries (git, API)
- **report**: Generate various report formats

#### Advanced Scanning
- AST-based widget tree analysis with parallel processing (8-12 isolates)
- Key‚Üîhandler linking to track widget-to-event connections
- Blind spot detection for untestable areas
- Cache system in `.dart_tool/flutter_keycheck/` with POSIX paths
- Incremental scanning with `--since` for git-based changes

#### Enterprise Features
- Multi-package monorepo support with `--packages workspace|resolve`
- Protected key tags for critical automation paths
- Maximum drift thresholds for controlled evolution
- External registry sync (GitLab, GitHub, custom APIs)

### üîß Improvements

#### Performance
- Parallel file processing with isolate pool
- Smart caching reduces scan time by 60-80%
- Incremental scanning for large codebases
- POSIX path normalization for cross-platform consistency

#### CI/CD Integration
- GitLab CI template with artifacts and metrics export
- GitHub Actions workflow with deterministic exit codes
- JUnit XML reports for test result parsing
- Markdown reports for PR/MR comments
- JSON schema v1.0 for programmatic consumption

### üìä Metrics Collection

New v1.0 schema provides:
- `parse_success_rate`: Fraction of successfully parsed files (0.0-1.0)
- `widgets_total` / `widgets_with_keys`: Key coverage metrics
- `handlers_total` / `handlers_linked`: Event handler tracking
- `detectors[]`: Individual detector performance metrics
- `blind_spots[]`: Areas that cannot be properly tested
