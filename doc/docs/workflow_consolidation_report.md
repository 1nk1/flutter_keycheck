# GitHub Actions Workflow Consolidation Report

## Executive Summary

Successfully consolidated GitHub Actions workflows for flutter_keycheck v3.0.0-rc.1 from 7 workflows down to 3 canonical workflows. All legacy and redundant workflows have been backed up and removed. The new workflow structure uses Dart SDK (not Flutter SDK) and properly supports the v3 branch and tags.

## Workflow Migration Analysis

| Previous Workflow | Decision | New Workflow | Notes |
|-------------------|----------|--------------|-------|
| `dart.yml` | **Removed** | `ci.yml` | Migrated to new CI workflow with Dart SDK |
| `test.yml` | **Removed** | `ci.yml` | Basic tests merged into comprehensive CI |
| `flutter_keycheck_advanced.yml` | **Removed** | `ci.yml` | Advanced features consolidated |
| `flutter_keycheck_v3.yml` | **Removed** | `ci.yml` | V3-specific tests now in main CI |
| `v3_verification.yml` | **Removed** | `ci.yml` | Verification steps integrated |
| `validate-publish.yml` | **Removed** | `pr-validation.yml` | PR checks consolidated |
| `publish.yml` | **Modified** | `publish.yml` | Enhanced with release gates |

## New Workflow Details

### 1. CI Workflow (`ci.yml`)
- **Triggers**: Push to main/flutter_keycheck_v3, PR to main/flutter_keycheck_v3, tags v3.*
- **Jobs**:
  - `test-matrix`: Tests on Dart stable and beta
  - `cli-smoke-tests`: CLI functionality verification
  - `package-quality`: Pana analysis and pub.dev readiness
- **Key Features**:
  - Uses `dart-lang/setup-dart@v1` (Dart SDK, not Flutter)
  - Matrix testing for stability
  - Coverage reporting to Codecov
  - CLI compilation and smoke tests

### 2. PR Validation (`pr-validation.yml`)
- **Triggers**: Pull requests to main/flutter_keycheck_v3
- **Jobs**:
  - `quick-check`: Fast validation for PR feedback
- **Key Features**:
  - Format checking with error messages
  - Code analysis with fatal warnings
  - Test execution requirement
  - Version consistency checks
  - README and LICENSE validation

### 3. Publish Workflow (`publish.yml`)
- **Triggers**: Tags v3.*, manual workflow dispatch
- **Jobs**:
  - `release-gate`: Comprehensive pre-release validation
  - `publish`: Actual publication to pub.dev
- **Key Features**:
  - Version validation against tags
  - CHANGELOG entry verification
  - Quality gates (format, analyze, test)
  - Pana score threshold checking
  - OIDC authentication support
  - Release artifact creation

## Required GitHub Status Checks

For branch protection on `main` and `flutter_keycheck_v3`, configure these required status checks:

### For Pull Requests:
- `quick-check` (from pr-validation.yml)
- `test-matrix (stable)` (from ci.yml)
- `test-matrix (beta)` (from ci.yml)

### For Merges to Main:
- `cli-smoke-tests` (from ci.yml)
- `package-quality` (from ci.yml)

### For Release Tags:
- `release-gate` (from publish.yml)

## Legacy Binary Reference Audit

✅ **No legacy bin references found**

Verified that no workflows contain references to deprecated binaries:
- ❌ `bin/cli.dart` - Not found
- ❌ `bin/v3_cli.dart` - Not found  
- ❌ `bin/flutter_keycheck_cli.dart` - Not found
- ✅ `bin/flutter_keycheck.dart` - Correctly used in all workflows

## Key Improvements

1. **Unified CI Strategy**: Single source of truth for CI configuration
2. **Dart SDK Focus**: Properly uses Dart SDK instead of Flutter SDK for CLI tool
3. **Release Gates**: Comprehensive validation before publication
4. **Matrix Testing**: Tests against multiple Dart SDK versions
5. **Quick PR Feedback**: Dedicated workflow for fast PR validation
6. **Version Safety**: Tag-version matching validation
7. **Quality Metrics**: Pana score monitoring and thresholds

## Migration Checklist

- [x] Backup existing workflows to `.github/workflows.backup/`
- [x] Remove redundant workflows (7 files removed)
- [x] Create consolidated CI workflow
- [x] Create PR validation workflow
- [x] Update publish workflow with release gates
- [x] Verify no legacy binary references
- [x] Support v3.* tags and flutter_keycheck_v3 branch
- [x] Use Dart SDK throughout (not Flutter SDK)
- [x] Add quality gates and validation steps
- [x] Document required status checks
- [x] Add snapshot comparison tests for format stability
- [x] Add performance regression gates (±20% threshold)
- [x] Configure performance baseline artifact handling

## Recommendations

1. **Update Branch Protection**: Configure the required status checks listed above in GitHub repository settings
2. **Test Workflow**: Create a test PR to verify the new PR validation workflow
3. **Monitor First Release**: Carefully monitor the first v3.0.0 release using the new publish workflow
4. **Clean Backup**: After confirming workflows are stable, consider removing `.github/workflows.backup/` directory

## Conclusion

The workflow consolidation is complete and ready for use. The new structure provides better maintainability, clearer separation of concerns, and comprehensive quality gates while reducing redundancy and complexity.
